    text: `After six months of research interviews, we finally merged the accessibility branch into main. The release includes keyboard shortcuts, focus outlines, and better color contrasts for contributors with different vision profiles.

We also rewrote the notification pipeline so it batches updates per workspace instead of per user. The new scheduler handled 3x the traffic in staging without breaking a sweat, and the ops team reported zero dropped messages.

Seeing everyone respond in the pilot group has been both humbling and energizing. Keep sharing screenshots, edge cases, and the "wish we had this earlier" stories - those bits keep the roadmap honest and grounded in real-world use.`,
